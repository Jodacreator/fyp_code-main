<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>
You will take part in a short decision-making activity with <b>{{ n }}</b> players.
The activity lasts for a fixed number of rounds.
</p>

<hr>

<h5>What happens in each round</h5>
<ul>
  <li>You will see some <b>HIGH / LOW signals</b> on your screen.</li>
  <li>These signals are shown automatically by the system.</li>
  <li>You will then choose how much to contribute to a shared financial project.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Whose signals you see</h5>
<ul>
  <li>You always see <b>your own</b> signal.</li>

  {% if network_type == 'ring' %}
    <li>You also see the signals of <b>two other players</b> you are connected to.</li>
  {% else %}
    <li>At the start, one player is randomly selected to be the <b>central player</b> and stays the central player for all rounds.</li>
    <li>If you are <b>not</b> the central player, you also see the <b>central player’s</b> signal.</li>
    <li>If you are the central player, you see <b>everyone’s</b> signals.</li>
  {% endif %}
</ul>

<hr>

<h5>How in-game earnings are calculated</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Each round you receive an endowment of <b>{{ endowment }}</b>.</li>
  <li>You choose a contribution (0–20). Your payoff is:</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px; background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #28a745;">
  <b>Payoff</b> = (Endowment − Your Contribution) + <b>State Multiplier</b> × (Total Group Contribution)
</div>

<ul>
  <li><b>State Multiplier</b> is fixed for the entire session but can be either a HIGH or a LOW value.</li>
  <li>The HIGH (0.7)/LOW (0.3) value is chosen at the start and stays the same across all rounds.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h5>Your decisions</h5>
<ul>
  <li><b>Contribution:</b> choose how much to contribute (from <b>{{ min_contrib }}</b> to <b>{{ max_contrib }}</b>).</li>
  <li><b>Belief report:</b> use the slider (0–100) to indicate how likely you think the true state is <b>HIGH</b>.
      0 means you are certain the state is LOW, and 100 means you are certain it is HIGH.</li>
</ul>

<div style="margin: 12px 0; padding: 10px; background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #6c757d;">
  Your belief report does <b>not</b> affect your earnings and is <b>not</b> shown to other players.
</div>

<p>
You will see your result at the end of each round.
